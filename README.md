# twitter-search
This program will search for tweets and save them to a .JSON formatted file. Twitter limits the amount of tweets that can be downloaded per 15 minutes; as such, when an exception is raised (i.e., the maximum allowed number of tweets has been reached) the script will pause for 15 minutes and then continue.
